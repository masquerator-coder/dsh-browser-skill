# Human help and recovery

With help enabled, use `browser_assist` action `request-help` for login, CAPTCHA,
OTP, payment confirmation, consent, or after two attempts without progress. Supply
a precise prompt and fresh targets; completion criteria need a stable success signal.
`all` and `any` support at most eight conditions in total. `urlMatches` accepts
RE2-compatible regular expressions of at most 128 characters. A compiled pattern
may contain at most 4096 instructions, and all URL-regex conditions together at most
8192, counting repeated patterns each time. Invalid or over-budget patterns return
`invalid_params` before help starts.
URL conditions do not auto-complete on URLs longer than 8192 characters; the user
can still finish manually. The protocol treats empty, null, and omitted
`url_matches` values as no URL-regex condition.

RE2 rejects JavaScript patterns such as `\u0061`, `a{1001}`, `[^]`, lookahead,
lookbehind, and backreferences. Some accepted patterns differ in meaning: `\a`
is a control character in RE2 rather than `a`, and RE2's `\s` does not include
Unicode whitespace. Rewrite patterns in RE2 syntax; use `urlContains` when a
substring is enough.
Resume only on `continued` / `completed`, then observe. Cancellation/timeout blocks
the step; do not repeat the request. Navigation alone is not success.

With help disabled, neither request help nor re-enable it. `disabled` grants no human
action or permission. Re-observe; use existing logins, authorized inputs and alternatives
within task/host rules. Vision models may try authorized graphical verification.
Phone-only QR scans, face verification, missing SMS codes and image-only tasks for
text-only models may stay blocked. Report missing inputs/capabilities or exhausted
alternatives; continue independent work. Never repeat unknown effects or switch
backends to bypass limits. Borrow confirmation still applies.

## Recover

- Unknown browser tool after plugin reload: invoke `skill` with `name: "browser-skill"`
  again (users can enter `/browser-skill`), then retry the intended browser tool once
  after its schema appears. If it remains unavailable, report the failure.
- Stale ref: observe, then retry the intended action once.
- Unknown tab/session: list owned resources or start a session with the required
  browser selector, if any; never guess IDs.
- Failed/interrupted stop: accepted cleanup continues in the background. Retry the
  same stop; completed cleanup returns `alreadyClosed: true`. For multiple pending
  stops, specify `session` or the owned `requestId` from the result/list/error,
  never both. The request ID identifies the original operation even if its short
  session ID is reused. Never switch sessions to retry cleanup.
- Timeout/unknown effect: inspect before retrying; the action may have happened.
- Unconfirmed fill: read the field. Formatting may satisfy the goal; correct only a
  remaining difference instead of blindly refilling or requesting help.
- Tool reports the local service unavailable, or a call fails to start: retry the
  intended `browser_*` call once, then report it and continue any work that does not
  need the browser. This is a local service fault, not a permissions or configuration
  problem on your side. Do not investigate it through an external command line, do not
  stop, restart or reinstall that service, and do not request wider sandbox access —
  none of that can fix it, and it can turn a recoverable fault into a lasting outage.
- Other errors: follow the hint; on unrecoverable failure, report and stop the owned session.
